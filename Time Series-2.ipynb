    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to patterns in time series data that exhibit regular fluctuations or variations at specific intervals of time, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. These seasonal patterns are not fixed but change over time, meaning their magnitude and timing can vary from one season to another. Time-dependent seasonal components are essential to capture repetitive and predictable fluctuations in the data, helping analysts and forecasters better understand and predict trends in the time series.\n"

In an AR model, the current value of the variable is expressed as a linear combination of its previous values (lags) and potentially a constant term. The order of the AR model (denoted as AR(p)) represents the number of past values considered in the model.
